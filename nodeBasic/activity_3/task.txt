build wcat command 

it is used to display or move a copy conetent of one or more files in the terminal


General Systax:
node wcat.js[options][filePaths]
option to remove big line space(-s)
option to add line number to non empty lines(-b)
option to add line number to all lines(-n)

commands:
1- node wcat.js file path -> displays content of the file in the terminal
2- node wcat.js file path1 filePath2 filePath3...... -> displays content of 
all the files in the terminal
3- node wcat.js -s filePath -> convert big line breaks into single line break
4- node wcat.js -n filePath -> give numbering to all the lines in the terminal

Edge cases:
1- If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error message
2- -n and -b are two options which are mutually exclusive so 
if user types both of them together only the first enter option should work
